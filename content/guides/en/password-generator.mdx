# Password Generator

Secure password generation is essential to create strong and unpredictable passwords.

## Entropy

Entropy measures the unpredictability of a password. The higher the entropy, the more resistant the password is to brute force attacks.

**Formula:** Entropy = log₂(alphabet_size^length)

## CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure PRNG)

Use cryptographically secure generators, not standard pseudo-random generators.

**Examples:**
- `/dev/urandom` (Linux)
- `crypto.getRandomValues()` (JavaScript)
- `SecureRandom` (Java)

## Length vs Complexity

- **Length**: More important than complexity
- **12 characters minimum**: Recommended
- **16+ characters**: Ideal for high security

## Best Practices

- Use CSPRNG
- Generate unique passwords for each account
- Avoid predictable patterns
- Use a password manager

## Conclusion

Secure password generation requires cryptographically secure entropy sources and sufficient length.
