# API Security

APIs are privileged targets for attackers. Appropriate security is essential.

## Authentication

- Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT
- Implement 2FA for sensitive APIs
- Validate all tokens

## Rate Limiting

Limit number of requests to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.

**Example:**
- 100 requests/minute per IP
- 1000 requests/hour per user

## Validation

Validate all inputs:
- JSON schemas
- Data types
- Lengths and formats

## Logging and Monitoring

- Log all requests
- Monitor errors
- Alerts for suspicious activities

## Best Practices

- Use HTTPS only
- Implement CORS correctly
- Version APIs
- Document security

## Conclusion

API security requires a layered approach: authentication, rate limiting, validation and monitoring.
