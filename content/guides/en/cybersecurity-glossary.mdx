# Cybersecurity Glossary

This glossary defines the most important terms in cybersecurity, cryptography and information security.

## A

### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

Symmetric encryption algorithm adopted as standard by NIST in 2001. Supports keys of 128, 192 or 256 bits.

### Authentication

Process of verifying the identity of a user, system or entity. Confirms that the declared identity is correct.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Authentication method requiring two distinct factors: something you know (password), something you have (phone), or something you are (biometrics).

### Authorization

Process that determines what actions an authenticated user can perform. Defines permissions and access rights.

### Argon2

Password hashing algorithm winner of the Password Hashing Competition. Resistant to GPU and ASIC attacks.

## B

### Backdoor

### Bcrypt

Adaptive password hashing function based on the Blowfish algorithm. Slows down over time to resist brute force attacks.

### Botnet

Network of compromised computers (bots) remotely controlled by an attacker. Used for DDoS attacks, spam, or cryptocurrency mining.

### Brute Force

Attack consisting of systematically trying all possible combinations to guess a password or key.

## C

### Cipher Suite

Combination of cryptographic algorithms used to establish a secure connection (encryption, authentication, integrity).

### Encryption

Transformation of data into an unreadable format without the appropriate decryption key. Guarantees data confidentiality.

### Asymmetric Encryption

Cryptography using a key pair: public key to encrypt, private key to decrypt. Solves the key distribution problem.

### Symmetric Encryption

Cryptography using the same key to encrypt and decrypt. Faster than asymmetric encryption but requires secure key sharing.

### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

Standardized system for identifying security vulnerabilities. Format: CVE-YYYY-NNNN.

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

Attack that forces an authenticated user to execute unwanted actions on a web application where they are logged in.

### CSP (Content Security Policy)

Security mechanism that allows specifying which resources a browser can load, reducing XSS risks.

### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

Standardized system for assessing vulnerability severity. Score from 0.0 to 10.0.

## D

### DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)

Attack that overwhelms a system with excessive traffic from multiple distributed sources, making the service unavailable.

### Denial of Service (DoS)

Attack aimed at making a service unavailable by overwhelming it with requests or exploiting a vulnerability.

### Defense in Depth

Security strategy using multiple layers of protection to reduce the risk of compromise.

### Key Derivation

Process of generating a cryptographic key from another key or password. Uses functions like PBKDF2, Argon2, or scrypt.

### DNS (Domain Name System)

System for resolving domain names to IP addresses. Vulnerable to poisoning and hijacking attacks.

### DoS (Denial of Service)

See Denial of Service.

## E

### ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)

Asymmetric cryptography based on elliptic curves. Offers equivalent security to RSA with shorter keys.

### Entropy

Measure of the unpredictability or randomness of data. The higher the entropy, the more secure a key or password.

### Exploit

Code or technique used to exploit a vulnerability in a system.

## F

### Firewall

Network security system that filters incoming and outgoing traffic according to predefined rules.

### Fuzzing

Testing technique consisting of sending random or malformed data to an application to discover vulnerabilities.

## G

### GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)

Authenticated encryption mode that provides both confidentiality and integrity. Recommended for new applications.

## H

### Hash

One-way mathematical function that transforms variable-size data into a fixed-size value (digest).

### HSM (Hardware Security Module)

Secure hardware device used to generate, store and manage cryptographic keys.

### HTTPS

Secure version of the HTTP protocol using TLS/SSL to encrypt communications between client and server.

### HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

Security mechanism that forces browsers to use HTTPS for a given domain.

## I

### IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

Intrusion detection system that monitors network or systems to identify suspicious activities.

### IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)

Intrusion prevention system that detects and actively blocks threats in real time.

### IV (Initialization Vector)

Random value used with a key to encrypt data. Must be unique for each encryption operation.

## J

### JWT (JSON Web Token)

Standardized format for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

## K

### Keylogger

Software or hardware that records keystrokes to steal passwords and other sensitive information.

## M

### Malware

Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt or access a computer system without authorization.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

Attack where the attacker intercepts and potentially modifies communications between two parties without them knowing.

### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

Authentication requiring multiple identification factors. See 2FA.

## N

### Nonce

Number used ONCE. Random or sequential value used to guarantee the freshness of a communication.

## O

### OAuth

Authorization protocol allowing third-party applications to access user resources without sharing passwords.

### OWASP

Open Web Application Security Project. Non-profit organization dedicated to improving software security.

## P

### PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)

Standardized function for deriving keys from passwords. Uses iterations to slow down attacks.

### Penetration Testing

Security test consisting of simulating an attack to identify vulnerabilities in a system.

### Phishing

Social engineering technique used to obtain sensitive information by impersonating a trusted entity.

### PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)

Infrastructure enabling management of digital certificates and public keys for authentication and encryption.

## Q

### Quantum Computing

Quantum computing using quantum properties. Potential threat to current cryptography (RSA, ECC).

## R

### Rainbow Table

Precalculated table of password hashes allowing quick recovery of a password from its hash.

### Ransomware

Type of malware that encrypts victim's files and demands a ransom to decrypt them.

### RSA

Asymmetric cryptography algorithm based on factoring large numbers. Named after its creators Rivest, Shamir and Adleman.

## S

### Salting

Adding a random value (salt) to a password before hashing to prevent rainbow table usage.

### Scrypt

Key derivation function designed to be memory-intensive, resistant to specialized hardware attacks.

### Session Fixation

Attack where the attacker forces a user to use a known session ID, allowing session hijacking.

### Side-Channel Attack

Attack exploiting information revealed by physical implementation (execution time, power consumption, emissions).

### SQL Injection

Vulnerability allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into a query, compromising the database.

### SSL/TLS

Encryption protocols used to secure communications on the Internet. TLS is the modern version of SSL.

### SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)

Vulnerability allowing an attacker to force a server to make requests to internal or external resources.

## T

### TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)

Algorithm generating one-time passwords based on time. Used in 2FA authentication applications.

### Trojan (Trojan Horse)

Type of malware that masquerades as legitimate software but contains malicious code.

## U

### UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)

128-bit unique identifier used to identify resources uniquely without central coordination.

## V

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)

Virtual private network that creates a secure and encrypted connection between two points on a public network.

### Vulnerability

Weakness in a system, software or process that can be exploited to compromise security.

## W

### WebAuthn

Web authentication standard enabling passwordless authentication via security keys or biometrics.

### Whitelist

List of authorized items. More restrictive security approach than blacklist.

## X

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

Vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page viewed by other users.

**Types:**
- **Reflected XSS**: Script is immediately reflected in the response
- **Stored XSS**: Script is stored on the server and executed later
- **DOM-based XSS**: Script modifies the DOM on the client side

## Z

### Zero-Day

Vulnerability unknown to the vendor and without available patch. Highly sought after by attackers.

### Zero Trust

Security model that trusts no user or device by default, verifying each access request.
