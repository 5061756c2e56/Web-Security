# Authentication and Authorization

Authentication verifies identity, authorization determines permissions. These two concepts are fundamental in security.

## Authentication

### Methods

- **Passwords**: Traditional, requires 2FA
- **Tokens**: JWT, OAuth tokens
- **Biometrics**: Fingerprints, facial recognition
- **Security keys**: FIDO2/WebAuthn

### JWT vs Sessions

**JWT:**
- Stateless, scalable
- Client-side storage
- No easy revocation

**Sessions:**
- Stateful, requires server storage
- Easy revocation
- More secure for sensitive data

## OAuth 2.0

Authorization protocol allowing third-party applications to access user resources.

### Flows

- **Authorization Code**: For server applications
- **Implicit**: Obsolete
- **Client Credentials**: For machine-to-machine
- **Resource Owner Password**: Avoid

## OIDC (OpenID Connect)

OAuth 2.0 extension for authentication. Provides identity information.

## Authorization

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Permissions based on roles. Simple but less flexible.

### ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)

Permissions based on attributes. More flexible and granular.

## Best Practices

- Use 2FA
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all tokens
- Principle of least privilege
- Logging and monitoring

## Conclusion

Robust authentication and authorization are essential. Choose the right method according to security and scalability needs.
