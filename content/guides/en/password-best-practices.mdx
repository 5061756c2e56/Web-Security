# Password Best Practices

Passwords are the first line of defense to protect your accounts. Despite the emergence of passwordless authentication, they remain widely used and require rigorous management.

## Creating a Strong Password

### Characteristics of a Good Password

- **Minimum length**: At least 12 characters, ideally 16 or more
- **Complexity**: Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters
- **Uniqueness**: A different password for each account
- **Unpredictability**: Avoid dictionary words, personal information, predictable sequences

### Entropy Calculation

Entropy measures the unpredictability of a password. The higher the entropy, the more resistant the password is to brute force attacks.

**Formula:** Entropy = log₂(alphabet_size^length)

Example: A 12-character password using 94 possible characters has an entropy of log₂(94¹²) ≈ 79 bits.

### Example of a Strong Password

```
Tr0ub@dor&3
```

This password contains:
- 12 characters
- Uppercase and lowercase
- Numbers
- Special characters
- No obvious dictionary words

**Entropy:** ~70 bits (good security level)

## Passphrases

An alternative to complex passwords: use multiple random words.

### Advantages

- Easier to remember than a complex password
- Generally longer, therefore more secure
- Less likely to be forgotten

### Example

```
Chien-Rouge-Sauter-Table-42!
```

This passphrase:
- Contains 5 words + number + special character
- Length: 28 characters
- Entropy: ~100 bits (excellent security level)
- Easy to remember

### Passphrase Generation

Use random word lists (diceware) to generate secure passphrases. Choose at least 5-6 words for sufficient security.

## Password Managers

### Advantages

- Generation of complex and unique passwords
- Secure and encrypted storage
- Automatic filling (reduces phishing risk)
- Synchronization between devices
- Security audit (detection of weak or reused passwords)

### Recommendations

- Use a reputable password manager (Bitwarden, 1Password, KeePass)
- Enable two-factor authentication on the manager
- Regularly backup the database
- Use a strong and unique master password
- Never share the master password

### Recommended Managers

- **Bitwarden**: Open source, free, cross-platform
- **1Password**: Intuitive interface, advanced features
- **KeePass**: Open source, local storage, full control

## Password Hashing and Storage

### Never Store in Plain Text

Passwords must **always** be hashed before storage. In case of data breach, hashes don't reveal original passwords.

### Hashing Algorithms

#### To Avoid

- **MD5**: Vulnerable, easy collisions
- **SHA-1**: Obsolete, vulnerable to collisions
- **SHA-256/SHA-512**: Too fast, vulnerable to brute force attacks

#### Recommended

- **bcrypt**: Adaptive algorithm, slows down over time
- **Argon2**: Winner of Password Hashing Competition, resistant to GPU/ASIC attacks
- **scrypt**: Designed to be memory-intensive
- **PBKDF2**: NIST standard, less performant than Argon2 but widely supported

### Salting

Adding a unique salt to each password before hashing prevents rainbow table usage.

**Best practices:**
- Generate a unique random salt for each password
- Minimum length: 16 bytes (128 bits)
- Store salt with hash (not secret)

### Implementation Example

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 12;

// Hashing
const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);

// Verification
const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, hash);
```

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Adding a second authentication factor significantly strengthens security, even if the password is compromised.

### Factor Types

- **Something you know**: Password, PIN
- **Something you have**: Phone, USB key (YubiKey), authentication app
- **Something you are**: Biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition)

### 2FA Methods

- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: Apps like Google Authenticator, Authy
- **SMS**: Less secure (vulnerable to SIM swapping)
- **Security keys**: FIDO2/WebAuthn, more secure
- **Push notifications**: Convenient but requires Internet connection

## Password Attacks

### Brute Force

Systematic attempt of all possible combinations. Protection: long and complex passwords, attempt limiting.

### Dictionary Attack

Trying common words and variations. Protection: avoid dictionary words, use random passphrases.

### Rainbow Tables

Precalculated hash tables. Protection: unique salt for each password.

### Side-Channel Attack

Exploitation of information leaks (response time, power consumption). Protection: constant-time comparison, secure implementations.

### Social Engineering

Manipulation to obtain password. Protection: training, awareness, 2FA.

## Password Policies

### NIST Recommendations

- **Minimum length**: 8 characters (12+ recommended)
- **Complexity**: Optional if sufficient length
- **Rotation**: Not recommended except in case of compromise
- **Verification**: Compare with compromised password lists

### Enterprise Policies

- Require passwords of at least 12 characters
- Prohibit common passwords
- Force use of password manager
- Implement 2FA for sensitive accounts
- Regularly audit passwords

## Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Never Do

- Reuse the same password on multiple sites
- Share passwords
- Store them in plain text (even in a text file)
- Use personal information (name, birth date)
- Write them on unsecured paper
- Send them by email or messaging
- Use default passwords

### ✅ Good Habits

- Use a password manager
- Enable 2FA everywhere possible
- Change default passwords immediately
- Regularly check for data breaches (Have I Been Pwned)
- Use long passphrases
- Generate random passwords for each account

## Breach Verification

Use services like **Have I Been Pwned** to check if your accounts have been compromised in data breaches. These services allow you to:
- Check if your email appears in breaches
- Check if a password has been compromised
- Subscribe to alerts for new breaches

## Conclusion

Password security is crucial to protect your accounts. By following these best practices - using a password manager, enabling 2FA, and using long and unique passwords - you effectively protect your accounts against most attacks. The combination of a strong password and 2FA provides robust protection even if the password is compromised.
