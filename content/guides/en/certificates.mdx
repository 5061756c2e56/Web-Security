# SSL/TLS Certificates

X.509 certificates are used to authenticate servers and encrypt communications via TLS/SSL.

## X.509 Structure

### Components

- **Subject**: Identified entity (domain name)
- **Issuer**: Issuing certification authority
- **Public Key**: Subject's public key
- **Signature**: Issuer's signature
- **Validity**: Validity period

## Trust Chain

### Certification Authorities (CA)

Root CAs are pre-installed in browsers and operating systems. They sign server certificates.

### Validation

1. Verify certificate signature
2. Verify chain up to a trusted root CA
3. Verify validity (dates)
4. Verify domain name (CN, SAN)

## Certificate Types

- **DV (Domain Validated)**: Domain validation only
- **OV (Organization Validated)**: Organization validation
- **EV (Extended Validation)**: Extended validation (green bar)

## Vulnerabilities

### Certificate Pinning

Pin certificates to prevent MITM attacks. Risk if certificate expires.

### MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)

Attacker intercepting communications. Protection: verify certificate chain.

## Best Practices

- Use valid certificates
- Renew before expiration
- Use wildcard certificates with caution
- Implement HSTS
- Monitor expired certificates

## Conclusion

Certificates are essential for web security. Proper management and appropriate validation are crucial.
