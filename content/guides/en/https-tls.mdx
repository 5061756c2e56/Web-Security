# HTTPS and TLS

HTTPS (HTTP Secure) combines HTTP with TLS to encrypt communications. TLS is the standard encryption protocol for securing web communications.

## TLS Handshake

### Main Steps

1. **Client Hello**: TLS versions, cipher suites, nonce
2. **Server Hello**: Chosen version, cipher suite, certificate, nonce
3. **Certificate verification**: Validation by client
4. **Key exchange**: Session key generation
5. **Encryption enabled**: Encrypted communication

## TLS Versions

- **TLS 1.0/1.1**: Obsolete, vulnerable
- **TLS 1.2**: Current standard, secure
- **TLS 1.3**: Modern, faster and more secure

## Cipher Suites

Combination of algorithms for:
- Key exchange (RSA, ECDHE)
- Authentication (RSA, ECDSA)
- Encryption (AES, ChaCha20)
- Integrity (SHA-256, Poly1305)

## HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

Forces browsers to use HTTPS for a domain.

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

## Certificate Pinning

Pin certificates to prevent MITM attacks. Risk if certificate expires.

## Best Practices

- Use TLS 1.2 minimum, TLS 1.3 recommended
- Disable obsolete versions
- Choose secure cipher suites
- Implement HSTS
- Renew certificates before expiration

## Conclusion

HTTPS/TLS is essential for web security. Correct configuration protects communications against interception.
