# Essential Network Protocols

Understanding network protocols is fundamental to securing communications and detecting threats. This guide covers essential protocols and their security aspects.

## TCP/IP

TCP/IP is the protocol suite that governs the Internet. It is organized in layers according to the OSI model.

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Connection-oriented transport protocol that guarantees reliable data delivery.

**Characteristics:**
- **Connection-oriented**: Establishes a connection (3-way handshake) before sending data
- **Reliability**: Guarantees packet delivery in order
- **Flow control**: Manages transmission rate to avoid saturation
- **Congestion control**: Adapts rate according to network state

**TCP Handshake (3-way handshake):**
1. Client → Server: SYN
2. Server → Client: SYN-ACK
3. Client → Server: ACK

### IP (Internet Protocol)

Network layer protocol that manages addressing and packet routing.

**Characteristics:**
- **Addressing**: Identifies each machine on the network with a unique IP address
- **Routing**: Routes packets to their destination via routers
- **Fragmentation**: Divides packets too large to traverse certain networks

**IPv4 vs IPv6:**
- **IPv4**: 32 bits, ~4.3 billion addresses (exhausted)
- **IPv6**: 128 bits, quasi-unlimited addresses, built-in security (IPsec)

## Security Protocols

### HTTPS (HTTP Secure)

HTTPS combines HTTP with TLS/SSL to encrypt communications between client and server.

**Advantages:**
- **Confidentiality**: Data is encrypted, unreadable to interceptors
- **Integrity**: Detects data modifications in transit
- **Authentication**: Verifies server identity via certificates

**Default port:** 443

### TLS/SSL Handshake

The TLS handshake establishes a secure connection in several steps:

1. **Client Hello**: Client sends supported TLS versions, cipher suites, and a nonce
2. **Server Hello**: Server chooses TLS version and cipher suite, sends certificate and nonce
3. **Certificate verification**: Client verifies certificate validity
4. **Key exchange**: Generation of symmetric session keys
5. **Encryption enabled**: Data is now encrypted

**TLS Versions:**
- **TLS 1.0/1.1**: Obsolete, vulnerable
- **TLS 1.2**: Current standard, secure
- **TLS 1.3**: Modern version, faster and more secure

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)

VPNs create an encrypted tunnel between two points, enabling secure communication over an unsecured network.

**VPN Types:**
- **Site-to-site VPN**: Connects two remote networks
- **Client-to-site VPN**: Allows a client to access a remote network
- **Point-to-point VPN**: Direct connection between two points

**VPN Protocols:**
- **IPsec**: Standard, very secure, complex to configure
- **OpenVPN**: Open source, flexible, widely used
- **WireGuard**: Modern, performant, simple configuration

## Routing Protocols

### OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

Dynamic routing protocol used in internal networks (IGP). Calculates shortest paths based on link costs.

**Characteristics:**
- Link-state algorithm
- Fast convergence
- Supports large networks
- Authentication possible (MD5, SHA)

### BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

Protocol used to route traffic between different autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet.

**Characteristics:**
- External routing protocol (EGP)
- Used by ISPs and large enterprises
- Based on routing policies
- Vulnerable to hijacking attacks

## Network Security

### Firewall

A firewall filters network traffic according to predefined rules to protect a network.

**Filtering Types:**
- **Port filtering**: Allows or blocks certain ports
- **IP address filtering**: Controls access by source/destination
- **State inspection**: Analyzes connection context (stateful)
- **Application filtering**: Analyzes packet content (deep packet inspection)

**Firewall Types:**
- **Network firewall**: Filters at network level
- **Application firewall**: Filters at application level
- **Personal firewall**: Protects a single computer

### IDS/IPS

- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**: Detects suspicious activities and generates alerts
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**: Detects and actively blocks threats

**Detection Methods:**
- **Signature-based**: Detects known attack patterns
- **Anomaly-based**: Detects abnormal behaviors
- **Heuristic-based**: Uses rules and heuristics

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160)

Vulnerability in OpenSSL allowing reading server memory. Affected millions of servers in 2014.

**Protection:** Update OpenSSL, revoke and renew certificates.

### POODLE (CVE-2014-3566)

Vulnerability in SSL 3.0 allowing data decryption. Forced servers to use SSL 3.0.

**Protection:** Disable SSL 3.0, use only TLS 1.2+.

### BEAST (CVE-2011-3389)

Vulnerability in TLS 1.0 allowing data decryption. Exploits CBC weaknesses.

**Protection:** Use TLS 1.2+ with secure modes (GCM).

## Secure Configuration

### TLS Recommendations

- Disable obsolete versions (SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1)
- Use TLS 1.2 minimum, TLS 1.3 recommended
- Choose secure cipher suites (avoid RC4, DES, MD5)
- Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- Use valid and up-to-date certificates

### Firewall Configuration

- Principle of least privilege: block everything by default, explicitly allow
- Segment network into trust zones
- Monitor and log all connections
- Regularly update rules

### Network Monitoring

- Analyze traffic to detect anomalies
- Monitor failed connection attempts
- Detect port scans and attacks
- Use tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, Suricata

## Best Practices

1. **Use HTTPS** for all sensitive communications
2. **Properly configure firewalls** with strict rules
3. **Monitor network traffic** to detect threats
4. **Regularly update** network equipment and software
5. **Segment the network** to limit impact of compromise
6. **Use VPNs** for remote access
7. **Implement IDS/IPS** to detect and block attacks
8. **Encrypt communications** even on internal networks
9. **Regularly audit** security configurations
10. **Train staff** on network security best practices

## Conclusion

Mastering network protocols is essential to understand and secure communications in a modern IT environment. Network security requires a layered approach: encryption (TLS), filtering (firewall), detection (IDS/IPS), and continuous monitoring. Vulnerabilities like Heartbleed and POODLE remind us of the importance of keeping systems updated and following security configuration best practices.
