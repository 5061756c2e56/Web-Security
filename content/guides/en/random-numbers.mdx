# Cryptographic Random Numbers

Random number generation is fundamental in cryptography. The quality of randomness determines system security.

## Entropy Sources

### System Entropy

- Mouse movements
- Keystrokes
- Thermal noise
- System interrupts

### Hardware Generators

- Generators based on quantum noise
- Physics-based generators

## CSPRNG vs PRNG

### PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator)

Deterministic, predictable if seed is known. **Do not use for cryptography.**

### CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure PRNG)

Resistant to cryptographic attacks. Use for:
- Key generation
- Nonces and IVs
- Tokens

## Vulnerabilities

- Weak or predictable seeds
- Nonce reuse
- Entropy leaks

## Best Practices

- Use CSPRNG for cryptography
- Never reuse nonces
- Verify entropy source quality

## Conclusion

Secure random number generation is essential. Always use CSPRNG for cryptographic applications.
