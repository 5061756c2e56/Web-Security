# Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt. Fast and efficient for large amounts of data.

## AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

Current standard, adopted by NIST in 2001. Replaces DES and 3DES.

### Characteristics

- Key sizes: 128, 192, 256 bits
- Block size: 128 bits
- Security: Resistant to all known attacks
- Performance: Hardware acceleration available

### Recommendations

- **AES-128**: Sufficient for most cases
- **AES-256**: For maximum security

## ChaCha20

Modern stream cipher algorithm, alternative to AES.

### Advantages

- Faster on processors without AES acceleration
- Resistant to side-channel attacks
- Used in TLS 1.3

## Comparison

| Algorithm | Speed | Security | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| AES-256 | Fast (with acceleration) | Excellent | Standard |
| ChaCha20 | Fast (without acceleration) | Excellent | Modern alternative |

## Best Practices

- Use AES-256 or ChaCha20
- Choose appropriate mode (GCM recommended)
- Generate keys with CSPRNG
- Never reuse keys

## Conclusion

AES and ChaCha20 are the recommended symmetric algorithms. Choice depends on performance and available hardware.
