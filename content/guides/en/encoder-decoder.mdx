# Encoder/Decoder

Encoding is the process of converting data from one format to another to facilitate transmission or storage. Unlike encryption, encoding is not secure and can be easily reversed.

## Base64

### Principle

Binary to text encoding using 64 characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /). Each group of 3 bytes is encoded into 4 characters.

### Usage

- Encoding binary data in JSON/XML
- File transfer via email (MIME)
- Storing data in URLs (with caution)

### Example

```
Text: "Hello"
Base64: "SGVsbG8="
```

### Security

**Important:** Base64 is NOT encryption. It's a simple format conversion, easily decodable.

## Base64URL

Base64 variant for URLs:
- Replaces `+` with `-`
- Replaces `/` with `_`
- Removes padding `=`

Used in JWTs and URL tokens.

## Hexadecimal (Hex)

Representation of binary data in base 16. Each byte is represented by 2 hex characters (0-9, A-F).

### Usage

- Display of cryptographic hashes
- Representation of keys and IVs
- Debug and binary data analysis

## URL Encoding

Encoding of special characters in URLs. Uses format `%XX` where XX is the hexadecimal code.

### Encoded Characters

- Space: `%20` or `+`
- `&`: `%26`
- `=`: `%3D`

## Vulnerabilities

### Injection via Encoding

Attackers can use encoding to bypass security filters.

**Example:**
```
<script> → %3Cscript%3E (URL encoding)
```

### Double Encoding

Some systems decode multiple times, allowing double encoding to bypass protections.

## Best Practices

- Never use encoding as security
- Validate and sanitize all decoded inputs
- Use the right type of encoding according to context
- Be aware of injection risks

## Conclusion

Encoding is a useful tool for data transmission, but should never be confused with encryption. Understanding different encoding types and their vulnerabilities is essential for security.
