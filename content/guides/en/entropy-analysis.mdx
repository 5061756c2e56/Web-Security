# Entropy Analysis

Entropy measures the unpredictability of a password or key. Entropy analysis allows evaluating the real strength of a password.

## Entropy Calculation

**Basic formula:** H = log₂(N^L)

Where:
- N = alphabet size
- L = length

## Strength Metrics

- **< 28 bits**: Very weak
- **28-35 bits**: Weak
- **36-59 bits**: Medium
- **60-127 bits**: Strong
- **128+ bits**: Very strong

## Dictionary Attacks

Passwords based on dictionary words have much lower effective entropy than their theoretical entropy.

## Recommendations

- Minimum 60 bits of entropy for passwords
- Use long passphrases
- Avoid predictable patterns

## Conclusion

Entropy analysis allows objectively evaluating password strength and identifying weaknesses.
