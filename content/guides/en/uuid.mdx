# UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)

UUIDs are 128-bit unique identifiers used to identify resources uniquely without central coordination.

## Versions

### UUID v4 (Random)

Generated randomly. Most used for security.

**Characteristics:**
- 122 bits of entropy
- Cryptographically secure generation recommended
- Extremely low collision probability

### UUID v1 (Time-based)

Includes MAC address and timestamp. Less secure (reveals information).

## Security

- Use cryptographically secure generators for v4
- Don't use UUIDs as secrets (they are predictable if poorly generated)
- UUID v4 is recommended for security

## Use Cases

- Database identifiers
- Session tokens
- API identifiers
- Cache keys

## Conclusion

Securely generated UUID v4 are excellent for creating unique identifiers without coordination.
